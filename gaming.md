# Rewarding players with web 3.0

Web 3.0 generally refers to the next generation of the worldwide web, supposed to take over from Web2.0, which is more centralised and focused on user-created content. Web3 is supposed to be a more decentralised web that challenges the dominance of the tech giants by concentrating the power and data in the hands of the users, instead of the big tech corporations. This means that data is distributed across networks and no single entity owns the information. 

This technology impacts multiple verticals but what I'm really excited about is gaming. Some of the most popular games today allow you to play alongside hundreds of other people in an online world. At the core of these games is the ability to be involved in shared experiences such as cooperative tasks and storytelling. 
Putting these games on-chain will allow players to win in games as well in real life. More they play, more incentives and rewards received.
There are lot of P2E (play to earn) games based on-chain but the one that really excites me is [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/).

# Axie Infinity
Axie Infinity is a game universe filled with fascinating creatures, Axies, that players can collect as pets. Players aim to battle, breed, collect, raise, and build kingdoms for their Axies. The universe has a player-owned economy where players can truly own, buy, sell, and trade resources they earn in the game through skilled-gameplay and contributions to the ecosystem.
Axie has very strong core characteristics which makes it better than others. While being a good game, it also acts as a social network and earning platform as it is mostly community driven. Players are able to have fun and work towards ambitious goals while simultaneously earning potential resources that will have real monetary value due to an open economic system.

# Game Economics
Axie population growth highly affects it's economics. At any given moment, there exists some ideal inflation rate that allows us to grow to our maximum potential. Too slow and Axie prices are too high for everyday people to join; especially competitive Axies. Too fast and you get unhealthy inflation. This is designed in the similar way our finances are.
Axie rewards players for the time and effort they spend both playing the game and growing the ecosystem. All these rewards are paid out in Axie's native token $AXS. We'll have a deep dive around $AXS and it's applications.

## Axie Infinity Shards ($AXS)
Axie Infinity Shards(AXS) are an ERC-20 governance token for the Axie Universe. AXS holders will be able to claim rewards if they stake their tokens, play the game, and participate in key governance votes. Players will also be able to earn $AXS when they play various games within the Axie Infinity Universe and through user-generated content initiatives. One great perk of AXS is it not only aligns the rewards between players, but also the developers who work for ecosystem to thrive. Simple mechanism here is given below

## **You must be wondering why web 3 for games and why play to earn.** 
### I'll explain why and how it benefits you. 
A game needs players. By simply playing the game, community members are adding value to the network and contributing to the project. This good deed should be rewarded. It’s simple, but revolutionary. These rewards can be earned by doing simple tasks in game such as :
1. Competing in the arena and winning matches.
2. Winning tournaments.
3. Interacting with and tending to your land plots.
4. Using the Axie Infinity marketplace.
5. Breeding Axies.
6. Using future Axie products that haven't been announced yet.

The Axie Infinity Shards earned through the Play to Earn allocation will initially be open for trading immediately, but the Sky Mavis team(developers and maintainers) will monitor the situation closely to decide if a lock-up on rewards is needed. These allocations may be increased when certain game mode or a in-game product is to be promoted.

## **A huge part of Axie ecosystem is dependant on staking of $AXS**
### But what does staking mean and how does it contribute to the project

Staking is a process used to verify crypto transactions. It involves committing holdings to support a blockchain network and confirm the transactions. It also allows participants to earn passive income on their holdings. This passive income is earned because the project puts these holdings to work and these generate more tokens. 
Axie uses staking as a way to reward our community members for having a long term mindset and locking up their AXS tokens. By staking AXS, users will be able to earn AXS rewards when they lock up tokens through the staking dashboard. In the future, staking AXS will yield to voting rights in governance and community treasury.
They are also planning to keep track of valuable members with help of system called The Axie Score.This score will depend on how much AXS a user has staked. 
More incentives will be given out to users with highest scores.

# Security of Play to Earn game models
A lot of things are happening while staking tokens and securing these transactions is necessary. Let's keep Axie aside for sometime and talk about security of web 3 games in general. Traditional online games have fiat based transactions but these monetary rewards are open to hackers. On the other hand, web3 trends imply that blockchain games would store currencies and items on blockchain. You could find the benefits of better control over ownership, rarity, or legitimacy with the use of blockchain in games.
It is also reasonable to perceive blockchain networks as immutable databases, which ensures security of play to earn games. The data and your rewards on the game would be under the control and maintenance of a distributed network of computers. The distributed network of computers or users has each user with a copy of the blockchain data. So, it is practically impossible to modify, delete or duplicate the data in the game.The play-to-earn games for web3 have the advantage of design for countering fraud or corruption. Players don’t have to worry about issues such as hacks, item duplication, and other vulnerabilities.

# Feasibility of Play to Earn Games
Coming back to Axie Infinity, many people in developing countries earn their living wages by playing and farming Axies.

Farming could offer you a promisingly steady income stream, where your earnings are related to the player’s skills and amount of gameplay time. Axie Infinity followed such a farming approach and helped people in the Philippines to counter unemployment. Players are able to make somewhere around $200 to $1000 each month by farming the Smooth Love Potion of SLP token. 

Even if farming offers lower benefits than trading NFT collectibles and items, it is a suitable pick for regular income. Games such as Axie Infinity also offer you the chance to use your NFTs for breeding new Axies. On the other hand, it is difficult to predict the value of a newly bred Axie quickly. The most expensive Axie as of October 2021 was Angel, with a value of $131,970, which is presently listed for 3000 ETH. 

The lucrative numbers associated with play-to-earn games might look tempting. However, they are random in nature, and it is difficult for anyone to predict average income for an individual selling NFTs from such games. On the other hand, the advantage of new technology would empower the emerging generation of web3 games. The different scaling technologies would ensure that popular models would shift to the new model of in-game purchasing and selling. Furthermore, the rise of the metaverse also shows a lot about the feasibility of the play to earn games for web3. 


# Conslusion
The existing gaming industry has done nothing wrong. However, play-to-earn games add a huge difference by introducing the functionalities of blockchain in gaming. You could have games that let you earn income only by playing them. In addition, players could earn in crypto or NFTs, which they can choose to trade. 

With a lot of promising talk about popular games with the “play-to-earn” model like Axie Infinity, it is reasonable to wonder how they would grow in the future. The formidable support of blockchain to ensure security and transparency alongside the involvement of NFTs and creation of massive communities would serve as prominent highlights of new blockchain gaming.
